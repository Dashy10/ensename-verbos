# Project Proposal

### Spanish Conjugator Application

I would like to create a CRUD web application that

conjugates spanish verbs for the user.

The user will type out the verb and in which tense they 

require the conjugation.

A div will then populate on-screen containing the verb

and conjugation based on tense. 

I will create my own API of Spanish verbs:

-Each table in said database will represent a tense

For example: 

- Table 1 will contain Present tense

- Table 2 will contain Preterite tense

- So and and so forth


Moving beyond my MVP, I would like to incorporate the

following features:

- Authentication for users so that only members can

edit and contribute to database

- Incorporate english to spanish translation of verbs

- Incorporate sentence examples into database

- Additional media, APIs, etc that will enable the web 

application as a fully-functioning source of Spanish 

language learning
