ERD or other visual representation of your database
---
This can be a basic markdown table with some text or a full on ERD. Check [this](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/how-to-draw-ERD) for a quick intro to how to draw an ERD. They also have a good tool to help you actually draw it.

Technologies used/npm Modules
-----------
List your tech stack. Include all the technologies you used along with a brief description of their functionality. Remember to include npm packages here.

Download Project & Install
----------------

This is a very important step and one that you did not need in your first project. When you have a project with a server and a database you need to give instructions to the end user on how to run it. the following is a good example of what this might look like.

1. [Git clone or download this project]('https://github.com/andres-maza/project-2')
2. Create a PostgreSQL database called 'project_2_db'
3. On your terminal, run psql -d project_2_db -f migrations/migrations.sql
4. If you haven't already, install nodemon package (npm install -g nodemon)
5. Run nodemon, app should be available on localhost:3000
