Project 2 (Your project name here)
-----------------------
A brief synopsis of your project. Should not be longer than a paragraph.

Wireframes
----------
checkout [this](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-wireframing--webdesign-7399) resource for some ideas about wireframing and some good tools that might help.

User Stories
------------
here's the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) entry for user stories.

Pseudocode
----------
Include some pseudocode. It doesn't have to be your entire app. Maybe a crucial function or two. Maybe a high level view of some of the way different parts of your project connect with each other.

ERD or other visual representation of your database
---
This can be a basic markdown table with some text or a full on ERD. Check [this](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/how-to-draw-ERD) for a quick intro to how to draw an ERD. They also have a good tool to help you actually draw it.

Technologies used/npm Modules
-----------
List your tech stack. Include all the technologies you used along with a brief description of their functionality. Remember to include npm packages here.

Download Project & Install
----------------

This is a very important step and one that you did not need in your first project. When you have a project with a server and a database you need to give instructions to the end user on how to run it. the following is a good example of what this might look like.

1. [Git clone or download this project]('https://github.com/andres-maza/project-2')
2. Create a PostgreSQL database called 'project_2_db'
3. On your terminal, run psql -d project_2_db -f migrations/migrations.sql
4. If you haven't already, install nodemon package (npm install -g nodemon)
5. Run nodemon, app should be available on localhost:3000
